                <h2>Microcarriers for Upscaling Cultured Meat Production</h2>
                <p>Due to the considerable environmental impact and the controversial animal welfare associated with
                    industrial meat production, combined with the ever-increasing global population and demand for meat
                    products, sustainable production alternatives are indispensable. In 2013, the world's first
                    laboratory grown hamburger made from cultured muscle cells was developed. However, coming at a price
                    of $300.000, and being produced manually, substantial effort is still required to reach sustainable
                    large-scale production.</p>

            <div class="sec-two-text">
                <p>Cultivated meat, also known as cultured meat, is genuine animal meat (including seafood and organ
                    meats)
                    that is produced by cultivating animal cells directly. This production method eliminates the need to
                    raise and farm animals for food. Cultivated meat is made of the same cell types arranged in the same
                    or
                    similar structure as animal tissues, thus replicating the sensory and nutritional profiles of
                    conventional meat.</p>
                <p>Dutch scientist Mark Post unveiled the first cultivated meat burger on live television in 2013. Two
                    years
                    later, the first four cultivated meat companies were founded. The industry has since grown to more
                    than
                    60 companies on 6 continents, backed by $450M+ in investments, each aiming to produce cultivated
                    meat
                    products. Dozens more companies have formed to create technology solutions along the value chain.
                </p>
                <p>Decades of accumulated knowledge in cell culture, stem cell biology, tissue engineering,
                    fermentation,
                    and chemical and bioprocess engineering preceded the field of cultivated meat. Hundreds of companies
                    and
                    academic laboratories worldwide are conducting research across these disciplines to establish a new
                    paradigm for manufacturing commodity meat products at industrial scales.</p>

                <p>By nature of its more efficient production process, cultivated meat is expected to have a variety of
                    benefits over conventional animal agriculture.</p>

                    <p>Cultivated meat will use significantly less land and water, emit fewer greenhouse gases, and

                        in fewer incidences of foodborne illnesses due to the lack of exposure risk from enteric

                    <p>Cultivated meat and other alternative proteins are predicted to take significant market share
                        from the $1.7 trillion conventional meat and seafood industry. This shift will mitigate
